    def __init__(self):
        self.measurements = {}
        self.process = psutil.Process() if PSUTIL_AVAILABLE else None
    
    def measure_operation(self, operation_name, operation_func, *args, **kwargs):
        """Measure performance with timing and memory tracking."""
        
    def run_multiple_measurements(self, operation_name, operation_func, 
                                num_runs=5, *args, **kwargs):
